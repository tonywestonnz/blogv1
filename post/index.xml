      <title>Zero Trust In Your Enterprise</title>

      <description>The Zero Trust security model, moves away from the idea that if you are inside the corporate network on a corporate device you can be trusted.
Instead its presents a security framework in which users and devices should not be trusted regardless of whether they are inside or outside the corporate network.
Every access should be validated. Zero trust model has become particularly popular as corporate data now resides both inside and outside the corporate network, including multiple cloud providers, SaaS providers, and increasingly users are working remotely and using their own devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing and the future of encryption</title>

      <description>HTTPS encryption is based on the premise that the product to two large prime numbers is very hard to factorise and obtain the original prime factors.
With a standard desktop computer it is estimated factoring a 2048 bit key, a common bit length for SSL/TLS, would take a little over 6.4 quadrillion years. A long time. Pretty safe.
Quantum Computing however will change that.
HTTPS is protecting most online activity. If it were to break it would be significant.</description>

      <title>Backups are number one</title>

      <description>Backups are number one Backups are arguably the single most important IT process.
HA, Redunancy, Change Management, I.T. Governance are all important, but as we know, sh*t happens, and good backups are your last line of protection.
Google, who are often thought of the leaders in data redundancy and availability had to resort to tape backups to retore Gmail data, after a software bug deleted multiple copies of redundant data.</description>

      <title>What should I be thinking about?</title>

      <description>As an IT professional, what is one question you should be regularly asking yourself?
&amp;ldquo;What changes can I do that means I am not required?&amp;rdquo;
If you can remove yourself, you have made a change for the better.
You always want to being thinking about Elimination, Simplification, Automation, and Documentation. And thatâ€™s the beauty of IT, all these things are possible and often easy.
You want to free up your time to think about the next big thing, rather than spending your time completing tasks.</description>

      <title>Blindsight</title>

      <description>I stumbled across the Rifters books by Peters Watts and that lead me to read his 2006 book Blindsight.
This is not a review, just a recommendation. It is a great read. I like Watts&amp;rsquo; writing style. Less is more. Leaves you wondering.
Classed as hard science fiction, it&amp;rsquo;s loosely about first contact and a crew of astronauts sent out to investigate a radio signal.
It is probably 5 years ago when I read the book, and still think about it occasionally.</description>
