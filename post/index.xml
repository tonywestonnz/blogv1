      <description>Backups are number one Backups are arguably the single most important IT process.
HA, Redunancy, Change Management, I.T. Governance are all important, but as we know, sh*t happens, and good backups are your last line of protection.
Google, who are often thought of the leaders in data redundancy and availability had to resort to tape backups to retore Gmail data, after a software bug deleted multiple copies of redundant data.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing and the future of encryption</title>

      <description>Quantum computing and future of encryption HTTPS encryption is based on the premise that the product to two large prime numbers is very hard to factorise and obtain the original prime factors.
With a standard desktop computer it is estimated factoring a 2048 bit key, a common bit length for SSL/TLS, would take a little over 6.4 quadrillion years. A long time. Pretty safe.
Quantum Computing however will change that.</description>

      <description>What should I be thinking? As an IT professional, what is one question you should be regularly asking yourself?
&amp;ldquo;What can I do that means I aren&amp;rsquo;t required?&amp;rdquo;
If you can remove yourself, you have made a change for the better.
You always want to being thinking about Elimination, Simplification, Automation, and Documentation. And that’s the beauty of IT, all these things are possible and often easy.
You want to free up your time to think about the next big thing, rather than spending your time completing tasks.</description>

      <description>Traffic Lights lead to incompetence Traffic lights serve a purpose. Maybe. In certain situations. But like lots of things - have they gone too far? What’s wrong with a round-a-bout?
On the occasion there has been a large scale power outage and the traffic lights are out, it would appear that traffic flows much freer, there are less accidents, and it’s an all-round more pleasant experience. In fact there have been several studies that have shown removing traffic lights improves traffic flow and reduces accidents.</description>
