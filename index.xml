      <description>Backups are number one Backups are arguably the single most important IT process.
HA, Redunancy, Change Management, I.T. Governance are all important, but as we know, sh*t happens, and good backups are your last line of protection.
Google, who are often thought of the leaders in data redundancy and availability had to resort to tape backups to retore Gmail data, after a software bug deleted multiple copies of redundant data.</description>

      <description>What should I be thinking? As an IT professional, what is one question you should be regularly asking yourself?
&amp;ldquo;What can I do that means I aren&amp;rsquo;t required?&amp;rdquo;
If you can remove yourself, you have made a change for the better.
You always want to being thinking about Elimination, Simplification, Automation, and Documentation. And that’s the beauty of IT, all these things are possible and often easy.
You want to free up your time to think about the next big thing, rather than spending your time completing tasks.</description>

      <title>Traffic Lights</title>

      <description>Traffic Lights lead to incompetence Traffic lights serve a purpose. No doubt (actually I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure what that purpose is, so there is doubt). But like lots of things have - they gone too far? What’s wrong with a round-a-bout?
On the occasion there has been a large scale power outage and the traffic lights are out, it would appear that traffic flows much freer, there are less accidents, and it’s an all-round more pleasant experience.</description>
